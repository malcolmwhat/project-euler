Goal
=======
*Emulate a personal assistant
*Develop a productivity tool that helps you easily keep track of your time 
spent on different things (studying, sports, sleep, robotics, chilling)
*It should also keep track of what you're doing
*It should keep track of what you need to do and by when
*It should email you a daily schedule (or text important reminders)

Design Questions & Considerations
==================================
1) Ergonomics (it MUST be easy to use) this is paramount I can not stress this
enough
2) Beauty
3) Functionality
4) Documentation 
5) It can be done Via computer (Day schedule can be beautiful)
    ---> Would be cool to have a Raspberry Pi Specifically for this purpose. 
        Would allow I/O opperations without the use of your computer. 
        Just ordered a Raspberry Pi 
        Your Order ID is: #RASPI-10655

Early Research Phase
=====================
Has this already been done? How and by who? What are the positives and the 
negatives of it?
Previous Notes
    *Obviously calendar applications exist, some of them are better than others.
    *The daily reminders exist but it is not tailored to things like a student 
    who needs to know what work needs to be done. Also if you could have it
    sent via text.
Negatives:
    *"Today Screen IOS": Not beautiful, has everything but is poorly organized
    *People seem frustrated by cuteness over practicality
    *Compatibility with existing things like google calendar, IOS calendar (unimportant)
