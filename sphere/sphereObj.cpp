//I want to create an extension of the shapes class from before
/**
 * IDEA: Instantiate a three dimensional vector.
 * This will point from the origin onto a the surface of a regular perfect sphere. 
 * Once this is instanciated, should be able to find the following, 
 * distance 
 * area
 * volume
 * vector in spherical co-ordinates
 * volume based on bounds? Oohhh
 * The circumference based on a given plane of intersection
 * The mass given a density, or even given a density function? This would require tripple integration though
 * Maybe a cross-sectional graph? This would be a cool exercise in visual representation that you could use external GUI's for
 * Gravitational attraction / kg based on distance? (This requires mass)
 * You could do something cool like a simulation of it as projectile using a basketball net or something. This would be kind of whacky in fact it's a completely different problem
