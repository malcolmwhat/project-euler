$sphereObj
==============

$sphereObj is designed to solve the following problem: Given a 3-d vector, and assuming it's end lies on the surface of a sphere centered at the origin I want to :
Be able to easily ask for
 * distance 
 * area
 * volume
 * vector in spherical co-ordinates
 * volume based on bounds
 * The circumference based on a given plane of intersection
 * The mass given a density, or even given a density function? This would require tripple integration though
 * Maybe a cross-sectional graph? This would be a cool exercise in visual representation that you could use external GUI's for
 * Gravitational attraction / kg based on distance? (This requires mass)
 * You could do something cool like a simulation of it as projectile using a basketball net or something. This would be kind of whacky in fact it's a completely different problem

 $TODOs
 =============
Use user input to create a vector object
use this vector to define parameters of a sphere
